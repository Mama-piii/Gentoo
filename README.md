Hello, and welcome to my GitHub!
Before using this script, please note that it was made for personal use only. It's not designed for anyone else, so I won’t be responsible for any issues that may happen.

Before running the script, make sure to partition your drive and adjust the script to match your disk.

The post-installation script performs the following actions:

Installs Flatpak and Gentoolkit

Removes temporary files

Installs GNOME and GDM

Adds a user to the plugdev group

Enables GDM

Installs and enables PipeWire

The installed applications are: nano, screen, pciutils, curl, wget, fastfetch, libreoffice-fresh-fr, dev-vcs/git, dev-lang/python, dev-util/htop

Finally, it updates the system and reboots :)


You can still report bugs — I might reply. Maybe.
