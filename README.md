Hello, and welcome to my GitHub!
Before using this script, please note that it was made for personal use only. It's not designed for anyone else, so I won’t be responsible for any issues that may happen.

This script installs a base Gentoo system with:

systemd

systemd-boot

gentoo-kernel-bin

root (/) on Btrfs

a make.conf customized for my own setup on an Acer Aspire 3 15" with an AMD Ryzen 5 5500U

You can still report bugs — I might reply. Maybe.
